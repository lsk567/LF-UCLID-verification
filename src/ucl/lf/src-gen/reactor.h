 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Header file for the infrastructure for the C target of Lingua Franca.
 * This file contains header information used by both the threaded and
 * non-threaded versions of the C runtime. A generated C program will have
 * either #include reactor.c or #include reactor_threaded.c. Those two files
 * #include this header file.
 *
 * This header file defines the functions and macros that programmers use
 * in the body of reactions for reading and writing inputs and outputs and
 * scheduling future events. The LF compiler does not parse that C code.
 * This fact strongly affects the design.
 *
 * The intent of the C target for Lingua Franca not to provide a safe
 * programming environment (The C++ and TypeScript targets are better
 * choices for that), but rather to find the lowest possible overhead
 * implementation of Lingua Franca. The API herein can easily be misused,
 * leading to memory leaks, nondeterminism, or program crashes.
